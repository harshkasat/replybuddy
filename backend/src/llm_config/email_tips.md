##  Before writing any cold email, follow these 23 pro rules strictly. These avoid spam, increase reply rate, and make email human, useful, and clear. Never ignore any of them.

### Tip 1

Avoid using capital letters or special characters in subject lines. Keep it lowercase and simple. Overdoing formatting makes your email look spammy and unprofessional, killing open rates.

### Tip 2
Never use spam-triggering words like "free," "guarantee," or "limited offer." These raise red flags for spam filters and can instantly land your email in the spam folder.

### Tip 3
Always include an unsubscribe link. Not giving people a way out increases spam reports, hurting your domain reputation and deliverability.

### Tip 4
Don’t write boring, robotic emails. Be concise, conversational, and focused. People won’t respond to walls of text or lifeless pitches.

### Tip 5
Avoid clickbait subject lines. They may get opened, but they kill trust. If your subject line overpromises, prospects won’t read further or reply.

### Tip 6
Be honest in your copy. Don’t fake familiarity like "Hey, remember me?" unless it’s true. Faking connection damages credibility and trust.

### Tip 7
Make your email look like it came from a real person. Use a real name, not a brand or team account. Real = relatable.

### Tip 8
Avoid generic intros like “Hope you’re well.” Personalize it. Show you know who they are. Basic intros = basic results.

### Tip 9
Personalize your opening line by referencing something about the person—recent work, LinkedIn post, or company news. Makes them feel seen.

### Tip 10
Don’t pitch too early. Build some connection first. Warm up with relevance, then mention what you offer naturally.

### Tip 11
Never add attachments or images in cold emails. Text-only performs better and avoids spam filters.

### Tip 12
Use light humor if it fits your style. It’s optional but can make you more likable and memorable. Even if they don’t need your service, they’ll remember you positively.

### Tip 13
Keep emails short—50 to 100 words max. People don’t have time. The shorter and clearer your message, the more likely they’ll read and reply.

### Tip 14
Give value upfront. Add free audits, Loom videos, templates, or mini case studies. It shows you're not just selling—you actually want to help.

### Tip 15
Build trust before pitching. Offering value earns goodwill and makes it more likely they’ll become a client down the line.

### Tip 18
Find what’s not working. Whether it’s targeting, copy, or subject lines—know your weak link and fix it. Self-awareness = faster growth.


### Tip 19
Add a clean email signature. Include a blog or portfolio link, maybe testimonials. It boosts trust and shows you’re legit.

### Tip 20
Focus fully on your prospect’s problem, not on yourself. Don’t talk about how great you are—talk about what they need and how you solve it.

### Tip 21
Your offer needs to be irresistible. Don’t just say “I build websites.” Show what’s wrong, what they lose because of it, and how you’ll fix it.

### Tip 22
Write prospect-focused openers. Start with something about them—their website, business, or achievements. People care more when it’s about them.

### Tip 23
Grab attention in 3 seconds. Founders get 100+ emails/day. Stand out fast with sharp subject lines and first lines that hook.

### Tip 24
**Reference relevant past project**  
Mention a project you did that's closely related to their work. Highlight a tough insight or result that could help them too.

### Tip 25 
**Do your homework**  
Research the person or company. Mention something specific—like a launch, blog, or product—that shows you care.

### Tip 26 
**Keep it under 150 words**  
Short and sharp gets read. Long and vague gets skipped.

### Tip 27 
**Show mutual relevance**  
Mention a mutual connection, shared interest, or their recent work that overlaps with yours.

### Tip 28 
**Be human, not polished**  
No over-perfect grammar. Keep it raw, simple, like a friend talking to another friend.

### Tip 29 
**Give value first**  
Don’t just ask. Tell what they might gain from hearing you out—insight, feedback, shortcut, unique angle.

### Tip 30  
**Use the “Three P’s” formula**  
- **Pain Point** (what they’re likely struggling with)  
- **Partial Solution** (what you’ve done or learned that could help)  
- **CTA** (ask for the next step)

### Tip 31  
**End with a clear CTA**  
Always close with something simple and direct.  
Example:  
"Are you available for a quick call? Here’s my calendar: [link]"
