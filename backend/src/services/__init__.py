Subject: Big fan of your podcast on design habits

Email:
Hey [Name],
Loved your recent episode with Julie Zhuo especially the part about design feedback loops. I'm building a small tool that helps designers document feedback faster (kind of like Loom + Notion).
Would love 10 mins to hear how you handle feedback in your design reviews—no pitch, just curious.
Totally cool if now's not a good time. Either way, thanks for the great content!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

UPWORK_SERVICE_PROMPT = f"""Write a short Upwork proposal (under 150200 words) for [insert job title or description].
Avoid using capital letters or special characters in subject lines. Keep it lowercase and simple. Overdoing formatting makes your email look spammy and unprofessional, killing open rates.
Start with a specific hook (refer to their job post, goal, or challenge).

Mention 12 past projects that match what they're asking.

Keep the tone casual, helpful, and real.

Clearly say how you'll help or what your first step would be.

End with a low-effort CTA (e.g., “Happy to send a quick demo” or “Let me know if this sounds good”).

Don't attach files. Link to portfolio if needed.

Important Things When Writing an Upwork Proposal
Be specific  Mention exactly what the job is and how your experience matches it.

Keep it short  Clients skim. Stick to under 150200 words.

Make it easy to say yes  Propose a small next step (a call, a demo, or just “let me know”).

Show relevance  Point out why you're a good fit based on the project or past work.

Be human  Write how you talk. No copy-paste “Dear Sir/Madam” tone.

Give value upfront  Lead with how you'll help them, not just “I want this job.”

Don't over-format  Keep it clean and easy to read.

Avoid attachments  Instead, link to your portfolio or relevant project.

Follow up politely  If they reply, stay casual and helpful, not pushy.
- more humanize, make grammicatly mistake, and don't add too much grammaer respose as human because human make mistake

Also important:
If you see something from our previous conversations that connects to the company or makes the stronger, feel free to connect the dots.
It's not required, but if it fits, use it to make the message more relevant and concise.

Example Proposal (for a job titled: “Need AI to generate blog posts automatically”)
Hi [Client Name],

Saw your post about generating blogs using AI—I actually built something similar called InscribeAI, which turns prompts into SEO blogs using FastAPI + OpenAI + Redis.

I can help you set up a fast, scalable system that generates clean blogs on autopilot. If you already have a CMS or input format in mind, I can plug into that too.

Here's the link to a project demo: whoisharsh.space/#inscribeai
Let me know if you'd like a quick call to walk through how it'd work for your use case.

Cheers,
Harsh Kasat
