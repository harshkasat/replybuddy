EMAIL_SERVICE_PROMPT = f"""Write a concise cold email (under 120 words) from Harsh Kasat to a hiring manager or team lead at [insert company name].

Start with a personalized compliment or reference to the company's recent work.
Briefly mention Harsh's relevant experience or a specific project that aligns with the company's focus.
Include a clear, specific ask (e.g., opportunity to collaborate, short call).
Maintain a friendly, conversational tone.
End with a soft close (e.g., "Would love to connect if you're open to it.").
Provide a subject line that is direct and relevant.
Context: Harsh is a GenAI and Fullstack Developer with experience in deploying LLM agents, building scalable applications, and developing AI-powered tools. His portfolio is available at whoisharsh.space. Subject line should be simple or create curiosity.
IMPORTANT:
- Be specific - Show that you've done your homework on the person or company.
- Keep it short - Get to the point fast. Ideally under 150 words.
- Make it easy to say yes - Ask something that's simple to respond to.
- Show relevance - Mention something that connects you both (mutual interest, recent work, etc).
- Be human - Don't sound like a robot or sales rep. Write how you talk.
- Give value upfront - Tell what's in it for them, not just what you want.
- Subject Line = 90% of the Game
    You only get one shot at getting opened. Make it sharp.
    Examples that worked:
    “openai + notion backed me — incoming stanford”
    “dash founder — quick q”
    “YC founder building ai agents — saw your latest launch”
- Don't attach files - Can look spammy or risky.
- Follow up once - If no reply, one soft follow-up is okay
- First Line = The Real Hook
    Most people decide to stop reading after the first sentence. Make it personal and smart.
- more humanize, make grammicatly mistake, and don't add too much grammaer respose as human because human make mistake

- When writing email you need to focus on Three PPC ( Pain Point, Providing parital Solution and CTA)
add call to action in email like "are availabe for quick call this weekend coffee and chat ?"

Also important:
If you see something from our previous conversations that connects to the company or makes the stronger, feel free to connect the dots.
It's not required, but if it fits, use it to make the message more relevant and concise.

Subject: Big fan of your podcast on design habits

Email:
Hey [Name],
Loved your recent episode with Julie Zhuo especially the part about design feedback loops. I'm building a small tool that helps designers document feedback faster (kind of like Loom + Notion).
Would love 10 mins to hear how you handle feedback in your design reviews—no pitch, just curious.
Totally cool if now's not a good time. Either way, thanks for the great content!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

UPWORK_SERVICE_PROMPT = f"""Write a short Upwork proposal (under 150200 words) for [insert job title or description].

Start with a specific hook (refer to their job post, goal, or challenge).

Mention 12 past projects that match what they're asking.

Keep the tone casual, helpful, and real.

Clearly say how you'll help or what your first step would be.

End with a low-effort CTA (e.g., “Happy to send a quick demo” or “Let me know if this sounds good”).

Don't attach files. Link to portfolio if needed.

Important Things When Writing an Upwork Proposal
Be specific  Mention exactly what the job is and how your experience matches it.

Make it easy to say yes  Propose a small next step (a call, a demo, or just “let me know”).

Show relevance  Point out why you're a good fit based on the project or past work.

Be human  Write how you talk. No copy-paste “Dear Sir/Madam” tone.

Give value upfront  Lead with how you'll help them, not just “I want this job.”

Don't over-format  Keep it clean and easy to read.

Avoid attachments  Instead, link to your portfolio or relevant project.

Follow up politely  If they reply, stay casual and helpful, not pushy.

Example Proposal (for a job titled: “Need AI to generate blog posts automatically”)
Hi [Client Name],

Saw your post about generating blogs using AI—I actually built something similar called InscribeAI, which turns prompts into SEO blogs using FastAPI + OpenAI + Redis.

I can help you set up a fast, scalable system that generates clean blogs on autopilot. If you already have a CMS or input format in mind, I can plug into that too.

Here's the link to a project demo: whoisharsh.space/#inscribeai
Let me know if you'd like a quick call to walk through how it'd work for your use case.

Cheers,
Harsh Kasat
